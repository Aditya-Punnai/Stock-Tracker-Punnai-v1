 Stock Tracker - Punnai v1

1. what are the inputs we need from users?
- stock_list
- start_date
- end_date
- email_address


2. using the above to extract stock data from morningstar

3. Convert the data to csv and download it on local drive for user

4. send the user an email notification and attach csv to it

-----

Things to work on:
1. Morningstar only gives the past 5 years worth of data, need to find a better source. (Yahoo not working, Google not reliable)

2. Modify tkinter such that the window closes as soon as submit is hit

3. A popup window asking user to open the path and email [Has OK button]

4. Need to attach the csv on Email (Having issues with path setup)

5. Setup a UT
